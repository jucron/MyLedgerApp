# MyLedgerApp

This is a small REST API project of a Ledger Application structured in a Service Oriented Arquitecture. 

### Data Structure
- Client (contains Ledgers)
- Employee (is necessary to open a Ledger)
- Ledger (contains Transactions)
- Transactions (can be a type Deposit or Withdrawal)

### Getting started
The simplest way is to Clone this repo and run it in Visual Studio.

You can also run
`dotnet build` and `dotnet run`


### Usage
When you start the application, you can access Swagger documentation generated by the App in:

`https://localhost:7039/swagger/index.html`

Start creating in this order: Users -> Ledgers -> Transactions.

Any Data can be fetch, created and deleted. But only Users can be Updated.

The app, before sending Domain data, will map those into Data Transfer Objects, hiding sensitive info.
